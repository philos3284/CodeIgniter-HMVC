INSTRUCTIONS:

Please rename the module folder in this directory to whatever you would like but make a copy first as stated below. Also, DO NOT rename the main 'modules' folder. Remember to name your models, controllers, and views with the same name you chose for the module you created. BUT, I recommend naming your model with an underscore including the type of file it is, for example: 'mdl_Test.' Otherwise, PHP conflicts have been known to occur. I've added a default module named 'NEW_module' as a convenice to copy and paste instead of repeating yourself when creating a new module.
