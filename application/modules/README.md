<b>INSTRUCTIONS:</b>

Please rename the module folder in this directory to whatever you would like but make a copy first as stated below. However, <b>DO NOT</b> rename the main modules folder located at 'application/modules' which is the directory you're currently in. Remember to name your models, controllers, and views with the same naming convention you chose for the module you created. BUT, I recommend naming your model with an underscore including the type of file it is, for example: 'mdl_Test.' Otherwise, PHP conflicts have been known to occur. I've added a default module named 'NEW_module' as a convenice to copy and paste instead of repeating yourself when creating a new module.
